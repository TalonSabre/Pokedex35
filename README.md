# Pokedex35
Pokedex Entries for the first 35 Pokemon
----
This app was made during my process of learning SwiftUI.

I did not create most of the code for this app. It was made during a lesson introducing Firebase.

  The things I implemented myself include:
  
  - More data (SpAtk, SpDef, Spe, Second Type)
  
  - Stats in the Detail view display as a percentage in a bar (where 255 is a full bar)
  
  - Card and Detail views can have two colors, one for each type (using a 'gradient')

Fixed a couple issues and things that bugged me (5-9-2023).

I'm not changing this app again anytime soon.
 It is here for reference and preservation.
