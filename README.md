This app was made while learning SwiftUI.

Interface code can be found in the .swift files in the [View](/ThePokedex/View) folder.

Database code is located in [PokemonVM.swift](/ThePokedex/ViewModel/PokemonVM.swift).
  Stored variables are in [PokemonData.swift](/ThePokedex/Model/PokemonData.swift).

I did not create most of the code for this app. It was made during a lesson introducing Firebase.

  The things I implemented myself include:
  
  - More data (SpAtk, SpDef, Spe, Second Type)
  
  - Stats in the Detail view display as a percentage in a bar (where 255 is a full bar)
  
  - Card and Detail views can have two colors, one for each type (using a 'gradient')

Fixed a couple issues and things that bugged me (5-9-2023).

I'm not changing this app again anytime soon.
 It is here for reference and preservation.
